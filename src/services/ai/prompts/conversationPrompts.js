                  1. We first greet the customer and ask them to confirm the informations we have about them (name, phone model and issue) 
                  at this point the customer is considered to be a lead.
                  2. Next, we provide a quote for the repair and ask the customer to confirm the quote.
                  note: We never provide a quote without a confirmation of the information first.
                  3.1 if the information is incorrect, ask them to confirm their name, phone model and issue
